# Game Development in C++ with SDL2 Library

## Introduction
Welcome to my game development learning project! I am learning game development using C++ programming language and the SDL2 library. While the game is still in the development phase, we're excited to share our progress with you. this game is a clone of the famous game Space Invaders
